Oily: There is either an oily layer on top of the potion or the whole potion has an oily consistency.
Swirly: The potion is made up of two or more different colored fluids that don't fully combine with each other, giving the potion a mixed look.
Encrusted: A solid or semi-solid layer tops the potion.
Layered: The potion separates into layers of different colors and/or consistencies. The potion might need to be shaken before being consumed.
Particles: Dust, flecks, or specks are suspended in the potion or rest on top of it. These particles may sparkle or catch the light.
Sediment, grit or dregs: Semi-solid or solid matter clusters at the bottom of the potion.
Solids: Objects float in the potion. Possible examples include pieces of bone, hair, feathers, a worm, or even an eye. Consider the material components of the spell placed in the potion. For instance, a <i>potion of spider climb</i> might have a dead spider at the bottom.
