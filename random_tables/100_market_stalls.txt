"100 Market Stalls"
Campaign Workbook -- The City
Dungeon June 2005

Not every stall in the market sells swords and 10-foot poles. The bustling trader's wagons carry all kinds of curiosities and unusual trinkets. Whether the PCs are heading to the potion shop or just passing through the markey square, here are 100 stalls to add a bit of color to their visit. In most cases, no prices are listed. Assume that everything is sold at about the same price as an equivalent item in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
