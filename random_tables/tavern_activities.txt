Miscellaneous Mishaps - Tavern Activities

Even if you've avoided the stereotypical meeting of heroes in the local tavern, chances are that your group will visit a public house from time to time. To keep those trips from becoming bland, here are a few ideas to add a little depth to the other patrons of an inn or tavern. Use them to describe a group of patrons or just a single person.

WHen your PCs enter a tavern, pick an even you think will pique their interest, or roll 1d100 for a random result. Most of these activites indicate nothing more than the mood or personality of the other patrons, but some might suggest interesting subplots.
